Let's have some fun!  With the new year upon us, we are introducing a new advice column to the Punchpass blog:  _**Liv and Learn.**_  We hope it will grow into a fun and informative way to share experiences and insight among the Punchpass community and beyond.  Besides, who doesn't love a fun advice column? 

This column has a twist -- YOU are invited to **answer** questions that come to Liv as well as to **ask** Liv questions of your own.  With each installment of _**Liv and Learn**_, we'll share an answer to the prior question as well as a new question for you to ponder & respond to.  

We hope that this will be a collaborative and fun way to share experiences and advice with other like-minded souls.  Let's help each other through troubles at work and share the trials of running a business.  Problem with a co-worker?  Problem with a client?  Problem juggling everything? Ask away!  

Let's kick things off with a question from a friend with an age-old dilemma:

_**I own a fitness studio.  I have two instructors in my studio who do not like each other.  They each take turns "telling" on the other one, and I'm tired of it!  Their personalities just clash.  I don't want to let either of them go, but their antics are wearing me out.  What can I do?**_

_**- Fed Up in Fresno  **_

This question has now been answered by one of you, our helpful readers!  [Follow this link for the answer and more.](http://punchpass.net/blog/2016/1/13/liv-and-learn-sick-of-being-stuck-in-the-middle)
