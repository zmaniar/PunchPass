Time for a little quiz!  How many different ways does Punchpass let you customize your messaging?  Let's take a quick inventory:

Punchpass sends automatic email confirmations on your behalf, including:

*   Pass purchase receipts
*   Pass expiration notices
*   Reservation confirmations (if you allow registrations/class bookings) 

These emails are **ALL** customizable...so you tell your customers exactly what you want them to know in each of these situations.

You can also customize the wording you show:

*   At the top of your public schedule page
*   Within each of your class descriptions
*   At the top of your public pass purchase page (if you sell passes online)
*   Within each of your pass descriptions

As you may know, Punchpass ALSO allows you to send custom emails to your customers anytime you like.  You can send a particular email to one or multiple customers at a time.  Our customers LOVE being able to send customer emails on the fly right from Punchpass.

So...how many different types of custom message can you send with Punchpass?  I counted 8!  Pretty sweet.  For simple online scheduling software, there is a LOT of flexibility with how you communicate to your customers.
