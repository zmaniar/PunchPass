title: New Report to Find Duplicate Emails
tags:
---

p>We've added a new report to help you eliminate duplicate customer emails in your Punchpass account.  Historically, duplicates have been permitted in Punchpass -- sometimes people have 'family' emails used by multiple people, or perhaps a mother receives the emails for her daughter's account.

However, there are two upcoming improvements to Punchpass that will require emails to be unique.  The first is auto matching a reservation to a specific customer.  This is in testing now.  It is working great, and it's saving the testers loads of time!  The second is customer logins - a customer's email address will be their login to Punchpass. So, the email for each of your customers will need to be unique.

To see your duplicates, go to **View Customers**, click the **Customer Reports** dropdown and choose **Duplicate Emails** at the bottom.  Easy!

When you select the Duplicate Emails report, the list of customers with duplicates will automatically be generated:

If you've found duplicates, what do you do about them?  Fair question! [Jump here](http://punchpass.net/blog/2015/7/22/how-to-solve-duplicate-emails) to read our blog post about cleaning them up.
