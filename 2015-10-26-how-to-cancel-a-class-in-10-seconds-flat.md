Every now and then, things don't go according to plan.  If you have to cancel a class due to unforeseen circumstances, Punchpass will allow you to cancel it. Just go to the affected class time & click "Edit Class".  You'll click the button to mark the class as canceled.

When a class has been marked canceled, that class shows as canceled on your public schedule page and reservations are no longer accepted.

If some reservations have already been made for that class, you can email the affected customers right from the class page after you've canceled it.
