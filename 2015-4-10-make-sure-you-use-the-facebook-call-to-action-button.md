Did you know that you can easily allow your customers to sign up for classes directly from your business's Facebook page?

Facebook recently made it much easier to create a Call-to-Action button on the home banner of your page.  If you aren't taking advantage of it, you should!

Here's an example from Punchpass client Inner Essence Yoga in Oviedo, FL.  This is a screenshot of their Facebook header.  See the Sign Up button?

That button is linked to their Punchpass hosted schedule page.  Their customers can easily sign up for classes right from their page by clicking it. 

The Call-to-Action button is EASY to set up.  Here is the Facebook [blog post announcing the feature](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/call-to-action-button) and support page explaining [how to add the button to your page](https://www.facebook.com/help/312169205649942).

Does your business use your Facebook page as a de facto web site?  If so, you're not alone -- that's often where the customers are, and that's where the conversations happen.  If you use Facebook this way, the Call-to-Action button is a simple way to help drive more traffic to your class reservation page.
