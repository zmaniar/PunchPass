Are you a personal trainer?  Or do you offer personal training sessions in addition to your group fitness classes?  Or maybe you offer massages in your wellness studio?  Punchpass' private sessions feature is for you!  

Private sessions are a part of the **Birch, Buckeye, and Banyan Plans.**

**What Are Private Sessions?**

Private Session let you quickly create a new class in Punchpass, and a reservation (or attendance) for a customer at the same time.  The class is marked as ‘private’ so it won’t show up on your public schedule.

**When Would I Use A Private Session?**

We added Private Sessions to help you with appointments, or 1-on-1 training/classes that are scheduled independently of your regular classes.

**How Do I Create One?**

When you go to a Customer's account, you'll see the button pointed out below.  (NOTE - only on the Birch, Buckeye, or Banyan plans.) 

You can then choose the class, the instructor, the day and the time.  The default setting is to create a Reservation, and we send a confirmation email to the customer.  You can also create an Attendance if you are recording a session after it has happened.  If you choose Attendance we also give you the option to choose which customer pass to punch.

**Here's an example of how you might use Private Sessions for your business:**

As an example let's assume your business has regularly scheduled yoga classes, but also offers Massage appointments...

First you need to set up the class & pass in Manage Account:

1.  Set up a Class for each unique massage type (e.g., "1 Hour Massage").  You'll do that by going to Manage Account => View/Manage All Classes => Create A New Class.  You don't need to create any class times because this 'class' isn't regularly scheduled.
2.  Set up a Pass to go along with each massage type (e.g., "1 Hour Massage" for $100 containing 1 punch for 1 use).  Be sure to tie the pass to the massage session during your setup.

Then you use the Private Session feature to book appointments....

1.  When someone calls to book an appointment, you can go into their customer profile and click the "Create Private Session" button.  From there, you can schedule the date/time of the appointment.  Set it up as a reservation if it's happening in the future so you can get it on your schedule.  
2.  When the date of the appointment arrives, you'll see that appointment on your Punchpass schedule just like a regular class.  You can click on the class, see the person's reservation, and mark them as attending.  At this point everything works just like a regular scheduled class in Punchpass.

**One Important Note:** This feature isn't designed to let your customers book appointments online.  We've found many of our clients want to track/record one-on-one sessions for things like personal training, but that the majority of time the scheduling takes place in person or over the phone.

Let us know how you like this new feature!! :)
