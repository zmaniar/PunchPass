Hooray!  Punchpass customer accounts are available!  

You can now let your customers create their own accounts in order to purchase passes, make class reservations, and manage their accounts.

Customer accounts are an optional feature, though there are lots of advantages to enabling them:

*   No more matching reservations!
*   Customers can book with one click once they are logged in.  Multiple class reservations become much quicker.
*   Customers can see their upcoming reservations right on the schedule, preventing duplicate reservations.
*   Customers can see their active passes -- including expiration date & number of spots left.
*   Customers can see their class attendance history and their used/expired passes.

A new [section of articles in our Knowledge Base](https://punchpass.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/categories/customer-accounts-and-logins) will help you learn more nitty gritty details and will help you set it up.  

The following video will give you a good overview of how customer accounts work and the different options you have:



We're excited about this new feature!  Take a look and let us know what you think.
