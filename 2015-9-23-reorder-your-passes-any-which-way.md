You asked for it, and now it's here!  Reorder your passes so they appear in the order you choose on your purchase page.

Just go to Manage Account => View Manage All Passes to reorder your passes.  Drag them & drop them in the order you prefer, and your customers will see them that way too. Let us know how you like it!
