You can use your device's emoji keyboard to jazz up your class names this way. Â Not all of your users will see the emojis -- that depends on the browser they use to see your schedule. Â But those customers that can see them will think they're pretty awesome!

To set up or edit a class name in Punchpass, go to Manage Account => Manage All Classes.
