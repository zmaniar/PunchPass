p>Now your customers can see the description of a class even if you aren't accepting reservations.  So you can customize your message for each class -- describe your class, encourage attendance, or tell folks what to bring.  Your classes are all clickable on your Punchpass schedule & the class description is viewable there.  

To modify the message at the top of your public schedule, just go to Manage Account => Reservation/Schedule Settings.

Punchpass provides simple software for managing your fitness studio.
