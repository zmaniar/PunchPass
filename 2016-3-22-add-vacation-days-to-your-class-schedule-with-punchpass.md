We all need to get away sometimes.  Here's how to let your customers know your studio will be closed for a day, a week, or a month...

**STEP 1:** Clear your schedule

While you're logged into Punchpass, click the green "Classes" button at the top of your page to see all future classes.  Delete each class scheduled for your vacation time.  This means clicking on each one and clicking the Delete link.  (Note - this is assuming you don't have any reservations for the classes.)  

**STEP 2**:  Create a virtual "CLOSED" sign 

Go to Manage Account.  Click View/Manage All Classes on the right side under your class list.

Create a new class called 'Studio Closed (or something to that effect.)  You could even add a description if you wanted in case someone clicks on it.  You don't need to create any class times if you are only doing it for a week.

**STEP 3:** Hang your "CLOSED" sign on the dates you're out

Click on the green the Classes button again.  From there, you can add the class manually to each day the studio is closed, at say 9am.   Now your schedule will reflect that the studio is closed for those days.

Now go and enjoy your time off!  You deserve it.

Punchpass provides simple software for managing your fitness studio.
