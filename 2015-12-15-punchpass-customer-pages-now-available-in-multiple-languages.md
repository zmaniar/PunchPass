title: NEW! Punchpass Provides Language Support For Your Customers
tags: Facebook
---
Now your public facing Punchpass pages can be translated automatically into the language of your choice.  So, your customers will be able to use your Punchpass-hosted schedule, registration, and pass purchase pages in their native tongue.   

For example, a Punchpass schedule page in French.....

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/35.png

or a registration confirmation in German.....

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/36.png

The change affects the class registration process, the confirmation emails, the pass purchase dialog, and both the list and calendar schedule view.

To make the change in your account you should first [read through this knowledge base article](https://punchpass.groovehq.com/knowledge_base/topics/international-language-support-for-public-facing-pages) as there are a few different areas to make changes.

To start, we have added translations for German, French, and Spanish.  But we are willing to add more, so don't be shy about asking!
