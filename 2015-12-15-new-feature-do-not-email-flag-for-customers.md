Have you ever had a customer who asked you not to send them emails?  Now we have a simple solution for you!  Just edit the customer & check off the 'Do Not Email' checkbox, and Punchpass will prevent any emails from inadvertently being sent to that customer.  Easy!

Please note that Punchpass **does** still send an email receipt if the customer purchases a pass online OR makes a class reservation online.  Those are customer driven events, so an email receipt is expected as a confirmation.
