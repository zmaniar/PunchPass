title: New! Easily Assign Prior Attendances to New Passes
tags:
---

Have you ever had a customer who forgot to pay for a class (or two) and then purchased a pass afterward?  Now when you assign that customer a new pass within Punchpass, you will easily be able to apply past "no pass" attendances to that new pass.  

This feature will help you make sure you're charging for every class attendance, and that no past attendances will fall through the cracks. You can start using it immediately. When you're assigning a new pass to a customer, all you need to do is check off any of the past attendances you want to assign to the new pass - that's it!
