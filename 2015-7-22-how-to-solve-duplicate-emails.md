title: How To Solve Duplicate Emails

Are you getting ready to enable Punchpass' awesome new [Auto Matching Feature](http://punchpass.net/blog/2015/7/15/new-auto-matching-class-reservations)?  If so, you'll need to run the [Duplicate Emails Report](http://punchpass.net/blog/2015/6/29/taking-care-of-duplicate-emails) to make sure you don't have any duplicates.  Running this report is VERY IMPORTANT since auto matching won't work with duplicates!

If you uncovered some duplicate emails, here's the skinny on what to do next.

**SITUATION 1: Family Shared Email** _- duplicates were created on purpose_

Duplicate emails are typically intentional.  Say, a mother & daughter are each customers, but the mother manages her daughter's account.  So, the mother's email may show up as a duplicate.  In this case, you must change the email address for one of the customer accounts.  Remember that each customer MUST have an email address in order to make an online reservation for classes.  So, leaving one of the emails blank is not an option.

**SITUATION 2: Duplicate Customer Accounts** _- duplicates were not intentional_

The other possibility is that the duplicate email was not intentional and you truly have duplicate customer accounts.
