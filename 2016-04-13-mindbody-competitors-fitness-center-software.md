We get asked about Mindbody Online a lot. Â Ever heard of them? Â If you've spent any time around fitness or yoga studios, it's a silly question. Â They are by far the biggest player in the fitness center software industry. Â At Punchpass, we are Mindbody competitors...though we operate very, very differently. Â 

## MINDBODY COMPETITORS? Â WE DON'T SPEND OUR DAY THINKING ABOUT IT.

To be perfectly honest, we don't spend a lot of our time thinking about Mindbody. Â We find it much more productive to focus on what our customers need instead -- simple,Â well-priced software to manage your customers, their passes, and attendance. Our customers tell us that we hit the sweet spot -- Punchpass is much cleaner than paper or spreadsheets and way easier to learn and manage than software like Mindbody that costs too much & is a pain to learn. Â 

## IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW WE COMPARE, WE'LL GIVE YOU OUR THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER.Â 

Though our day to day lives are spent focused on our customer needs &Â not our competitors,Â we have to admit that get an awful lot of inquiries from folks who are looking for a less expensive & less complicated Mindbody competitor. Â And they want to know why Punchpass is better. Â In that spirit, we recently drew up some reasons to consider Punchpass as a great alternative to Mindbody.
