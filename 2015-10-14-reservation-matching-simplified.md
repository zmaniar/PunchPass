title: Reservation Matching Simplified!

We've made some improvements to how you match incoming reservations to your existing customers within Punchpass.  

A notification will be shown on the top of the home screen if you have reservations that need to be matched.  A green button will also be shown on the home screen if you have reservations enabled.

Clicking the green button will allow you to see ALL your **unmatched** class reservations so you can process them all at once.

We also added unmatched reservations right on the class details page so you can quickly process them right there.

We've improved the layout and messaging to make things simpler for you as well.

If you enable our recent [A](http://punchpass.net/blog/2015/7/15/new-auto-matching-class-reservations)[uto matching](http://punchpass.net/blog/2015/7/15/new-auto-matching-class-reservations) feature, you will minimize the number of matches you'll have to make.  But there are occasions when a manual match is required.

Hope you like the changes!  We'd love to hear your feedback :)
