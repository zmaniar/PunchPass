title: Embed Pass Purchasing On Your Website
tags: 
---

You can now embed the online payments form right on your website, just like you can with the online schedule. So your customers can purchase passes from you without ever leaving your site. And yeah, unlike some competitors we don't charge extra for this feature either. No extra 'widget' required! :)

It works just like embedding the online schedule - here are a couple of example pages:
