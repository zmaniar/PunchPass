Good news!  We added a pass description field that shows on the online public purchase page.   So now you can add juicy details about each pass you sell online.

To add descriptions for your existing passes, just go to Manage Account.  Click on each of your passes to edit their pass definitions.

We've also added a link on the pass definition page that that is the direct link to the public page for that specific pass.  So if you have a button on your website that you want to link to a specific pass purchase page, this is for you!
