Big news!  We're thrilled to introduce a new feature to Punchpass -- **Class Series**.   We know a lot of you offer your classes in _sessions_.   Now you can bundle all the class times of a specific class together so your customers can register for the group of classes all at once. This will make things a LOT easier for you and your customers. 

To learn more about how Class Series work, we've put together a short video overview...

There is also a [Knowledge Base article](http://support.punchpass.net/knowledge_base/topics/how-to-create-a-series-of-classes) explaining all the details.

Read all about them, give them a try, and let us know what questions you have.
