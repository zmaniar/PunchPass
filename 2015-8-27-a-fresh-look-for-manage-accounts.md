title: A Fresh Feel For 'Manage Account' Page
tags:
---

The Manage Account page is like an old friend to our Punchpass customers.  But with all of the new features we've added to Punchpass over the past months, the page was starting to seem a bit cluttered.  We decided it was time for some housecleaning!

We nestled different groups of features under icons at the top of the page.   But we kept the most frequently accessed information -- your passes & classes -- right on the home screen.

This new look has an added bonus too:  It gives us plenty of wiggle room for the many new features we intend to roll out to Punchpass in the future! Let us know how you like it.
