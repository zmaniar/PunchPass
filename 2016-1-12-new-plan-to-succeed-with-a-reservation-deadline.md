Do you need to know how many people to expect at class so you can set up properly?   Maybe you'd even cancel class without a minimum number of advance registrants?

Now Punchpass lets you close reservations for a set amount of time before classes start! 

To set this up in Punchpass, click on Manage Account, then Reservation/Schedule Settings.

On the left side, change the number of hours before a class that reservations should be closed.  This applies to ALL classes that accept reservations.  The default is 0 hours.

Don't forget to click 'Save Reservation Changes' at the bottom!

Now if customers click on a class on the schedule and (to use the example above) it's less than 2 hours before the class starts, they will see a message telling them reservations need to be made at least 2 hours before class starts.
